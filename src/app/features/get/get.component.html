<div class="method-container">
    <p class="title">get(path: string, requestOptions?: RequestOptions): Observable< T ></p>
    <p>The method of the generated data-service calls directly genese-angular get() method which is getting an object from backend and which maps it with the type T (in this example, T = Book)</p>
    <p>Here, the method calls the NestJS backend and returns the book with the id 1.</p>
    <p>Open your navigator console. In the tab "Network", you'll find the data received from the GET request. In the tab "Network", you'll find the data received from the getAll() request. In the tab "Console", you'll can compare these original data with the formatted objects sent as Observable by genese-angular. As you can see, genese-angular formatted the returned object with "Book" type.</p>
